## Hi, I’m @utsusemi82 👋

空蝉 comes from Japanese うつせみ (utsusemi) which originally means the empty shell left by the cicada after its transformation. It was later extended by Buddhists to imply "flesh", which is the rest of a person except the soul. Because a cicada's existence is so brief, this word also means "an impermanent and short life".
